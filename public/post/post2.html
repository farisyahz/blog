    <p class="font-inter text-slate-800 2xl:text-2xl md:text-lg text-base mb-5 indent-10">So as I mentioned in the About page, I created this website just to simply share my experiences, ideas, and creations to everyone. But that is not the main reason. The main reason is actually to store all of my creations that I've made and the projects that I've worked on into this website. So I can also use this website as my portfolio whenever I need it. Moreover, with this website all of my project will be well-documented, so whenever I want to see my past project, I just need to open this website.</p>
    <h2 class="font-inter font-bold 2xl:text-4xl lg:text-3xl md:text-2xl text-xl mb-2">What's Next?</h2>
    <p class="font-inter text-slate-800 2xl:text-2xl md:text-lg text-base mb-5 indent-10">Well, there is a lot of things that I want to do. The closest thing is I want to make some sort of a website and build a business on top of it (I will tell you more about this in the other post). By creating that website I hope I can learn more about web development, especially the latest technology and framework that are needed to make a website such as react JS, Node JS, Express JS, Next JS, database, APIs, and so much more. I'm also interested to learn about mobile development, I prolly just gonna learn dart programming language and Flutter as a framework.</p>
    <p class="font-inter text-slate-800 2xl:text-2xl md:text-lg text-base mb-5 indent-10">Besides that, I will also make some project with arduino and just try to combine it with AI and Machine learning. That sounds very interesting. AI and ML is also something that I really look forward to learn. Especially after the presence of chat-GPT that is VERY impressive. Just think about how it's going to looks like 10 years from know, that's crazy. I want to learn what's going on at the foundational level. I've tried to learn about it though, but it requires quite advance mathematics such as probability, statistic, and multivariable calculus that I had no idea what that was at the time. But now that I've covered some of that, let's see if I can understand it this time.</p>
    <p class="font-inter text-slate-800 2xl:text-2xl md:text-lg text-base mb-5 indent-10">So that was just a preview of what I'm going to do next. I still have one and a half semester left in highschool and I just want to spent all of that time to do something valuable for me and something I truly love doing. Let's call it <b>The New Chapter!</b>. </p>
    <p class="font-inter text-slate-800 2xl:text-2xl md:text-lg text-base mb-5 indent-10">I think that's all everything that I wanna tell you in my first ever post and see you guys in another post.</p>
